User Data Visualization Repository
Welcome to the User Data Visualization repository! This repository contains various files and scripts for visualizing and analyzing user demographic and financial information. Below is a detailed description of each file in the repository:

Flask Application User Data.py: This Python script implements a Flask application that interacts with user data. It includes routes and functions for retrieving and processing user data.

Jupyter Lab Codes for visualization: This directory contains Jupyter Lab notebooks used for data visualization. These notebooks include code snippets and explanations for generating visualizations from user data. The images "ages_highest_income.png" and "gender_distribution.png" were generated from these notebooks.

LICENSE: This file contains the license for the repository, specifying the terms under which the contents can be used, modified, and distributed.

README.md: This file serves as the main documentation for the repository, providing an overview of its contents and purpose.

ages_highest_income.png: This image file displays a bar plot showing the relationship between user age and total income. It was generated from the Jupyter Lab code for visualization.

csv export algorithm.py: This Python script exports data from a website's database to a CSV file. It includes code for connecting to the database, querying data, and writing it to a CSV file. The "user_data.csv" file in the repository was extracted using this script.

gender_distribution.png: This image file illustrates the distribution of gender across different spending categories. It was generated from the Jupyter Lab code for visualization.

index.html: This HTML file is part of the Flask application and contains the user interface for interacting with the user data. It includes forms, tables, or charts for displaying information.

user_data.csv: This CSV file contains user demographic and financial information. It serves as the primary data source for analysis and visualization in the repository.
